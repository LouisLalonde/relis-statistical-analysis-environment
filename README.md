# relis-statistical-templates

## üîç Overview

This repository defines the *Relis* statistical classification executable artifacts for the [relis-statistical-classification](https://github.com/LouisLalonde/relis-statistical-classification) (*RSC*) DSL.

The executable artifacts are automatically generated by executing a template code generation with the PHP TWIG library.

Two executable artifacts are generated:

1. relis_statistics_lib.py
2. relis_statistics_playground.py

The `relis_statistics_lib` executable artifact defines the analysis configuration, data types (which conforms to the (*RSC*) metamodel), utility functions and statistical functions which are used to perform the statistical classification analysis.  

The `relis_statistics_playground` executable artifact provides a direct access to the various combinations of statistical functions that can be used by the user based on its project specification.
